# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

                                       <li>
                                         We highly recommend NOT reviewing your proof on a cell phone or mobile device. If there are small details in your print and you approve it without adequately reviewing them, we cannot be held responsible. If you wear reading glasses or corrective lenses, please put them on when reviewing your artwork.

                                       </li>
                                       <li>

Once you have approved, we will not re-print or give refunds for art errors, provided we are not at fault.</u>
