# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

                         <p class='red'>Regarding Payment</p>
                         <p>Once a down payment has been received or alternative terms of payment have been finalized,
                            the garments and size breakdowns on your invoice are final.
                            In the interest of ensuring fast turnaround,
                            custom order garments are ordered into our warehouse immediately following receipt of your payment.
                            If a new garment or size breakdown is needed after the original garments have been ordered,
                            garment replacement fees may apply.
                            We are flexible to make a special arrangement if circumstances necessitate submission of
                            payment prior to garment decisions being finalized, whether it be color, style, or size breakdowns.</p>
                         <p class='red'>Regarding Garment Availability</p>
                         <p>Unexpected changes in garment availability, although rare, may occur.
                            If you've finalized your garment selection and this occurs,
                            and it is determined we will not be able to provide you with the garment of your choosing,
                            you will be contacted by a salesperson so that alternate options may be discussed.</p>"
