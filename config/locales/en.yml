# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

                                     <ol>
                                       <li>
                                         We will print <i>exactly</i> what is show in this proof.
                                         <u>Please note that color accuracy cannot be guaranteed, as appearance varies across computer monitors.</u>
                                       </li>
                                       <li>
                                         We highly recommend NOT reviewing your proof on a cell phone or mobile device. If there are small details in your print and you approve it without adequately reviewing them, we cannot be held responsible. If you wear reading glasses or corrective lenses, please put them on when reviewing your artwork.
                                       </li>

                                         If you are not 100% confident that you understand the content of what is going to be printed, we can provide additional close-up images upon request.
                                       </li>
                                       <li>
                                       Let us know if you would like something changed, if anything is included that shouldn't be, or if something has been omitted (for example, if a name was mistakenly left off a list of group members).
                                       </li>
                                       <li>
                                         <u>Your approval of the proofs communicates to us your acceptance of responsibility for the content of what is printed on your garments, provided we print exactly what you have approved. Once you have approved, we will not re-print or give refunds for art errors, provided we are not at fault.</u>
                                       </li>
