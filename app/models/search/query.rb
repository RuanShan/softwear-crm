    # Here it is. The almighty search function. Stuff like this gets a little
    # hairy, due to the nature of Sunspot's DSL. If you're unfamiliar with
    # how Sunspot looks in action, check out https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot.
    # 
    # You may notice that Sunspot works similar to RSpec, in that is looks
    # very english and reads well. Technically speaking, however, it's a bit
    # odd, since somehow the 'with' and 'all_of' etc. methods are all of a 
    # sudden available even though you never defined them or included them.
    # This is because it uses instance_eval(&block), which actually sets the
    # context (self) for the block body.
    # Here's an example of what this can do:
    # 
    # a = [1, 2, 3].join(', ')
    # # is equivalent to:
    # a = [1, 2, 3].instance_eval { join(', ') }
    # 
    # In the second part, the context of the { join(', ') } block is set 
    # to the array. Here's another interesting example.
    # Consider this method definition:
    # 
    # def something
    #   'man'
    # end
    # 
    # Now, let's do this:
    # 
    # str = "hey there ".concat(something)
    # 
    # Kind of stupid, but it would assign str to "hey there man".
    # Now, let's try using instance_eval like in the last example
    # to make it even more stupid:
    #
    # str = "hey there ".instance_eval { concat(something) }
    # 
    # This would actually raise a NoMethodError, because 'something' is
    # not defined within String. This is largely why it's inevidably
    # messy to interact with these DSL procs required for Sunspot.
    # It seems impossible to do anything dynamic since you can't access
    # your methods, but oddly enough, local variables actually do carry
    # over.
    #
    # Consider the 'something' method definition above:
    # 
    # local_thing = something
    # str = "hey there ".instance_eval { concat(local_thing) }
    # 
    # That will actually have the desired effect, dang!
    # 
    # As much as it is pretty cool that we can carry over our data, it
    # makes it difficult to split up our functionality into functions
    # after a certain point.
    # 
    # QueriesController contains an interesting workaround that may
    # be hard to grasp at first, but is much easier to work with
    # once you do.
